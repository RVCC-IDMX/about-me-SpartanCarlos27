Carlos Gonzalez About Me Final Project

***Description***

The purpose of this assignment is to transform the About Me project into a full-fledged personal webpage, and to properly document the process behind it. The project demonstrates that I am able to use my Github account and the tools it provides me to create a local webpage, including the use of HTML5 to include links, images, and sometimes embedding video. It also shows that I can properly link my work to Netifly and use it to publish my website, as well as an understanding of how CPR(Commit, Push, Review) is to be practiced. Proficiency in CSS is demonstrated by the inclusion of elements that enhance the general responsiveness of the webpage over multiple displays. These elements affect the presentation of the page, and include the use tables, forms, nav bars, and devtools.
